RPC++ is a C++ Remote Procedure Call library. It allows classes to be created that, when instantiated, are created on a remote server, and all method calls are passed to the server with the results returned to the client.  It is designed to make creation of remote classes as easy as possible.  It supports in, out, and in/out parameters and type-safe marshalling of user-defined data types.
